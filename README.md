DESCRIPTION:
Alstom Grid provides the most advanced electrical grid solutions that meet world electricity demands.  They boast technologies and expertise guaranteed to ensure higher safety, reliability and capacity of power grids around the world.  The company currently has a very rudimentary file-based historian that collects real-time data from an open-source software openPDC. The company asked the team to redevelop that historian with a more user-friendly interface with data retrieval and visualization tool capabilities. Ultimately the end-user should be able to; 1) identify data available within the openPDC Historian, 2) offer the user the ability to select and view trends of available data, and 3) export subsets of the data in a human-readable format.
